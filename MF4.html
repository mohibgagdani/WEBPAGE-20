    <br><br>
    <font size="4">
        How car loan applications work in the traditional way can be highly time consuming and inconvenient. Often, they
        require multiple bank visits, multiple calculations for loans from various providers, and may even prove to be
        greatly inefficient, especially when you have incomplete information on the various aspects related to the
        financing, such as the interest fees, foreclosure clause, loan tenure, EMIs, etc. Maruti Suzuki Smart Finance
        aims to provide a reliable and comfortable customer experience with complete car finance solutions. Maruti
        Suzuki Smart Finance allows for a hassle-free car finance process, right from looking for various offers and
        preparing the documents to getting the documents verified and getting approval for the loan. It facilitates EMI
        calculations & customisations as well with an EMI Calculator which gives an approximate value of monthly
        instalments that you will have to pay, based on the amount of down payment and interest rate.
